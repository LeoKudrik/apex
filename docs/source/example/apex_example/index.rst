Apex Example
================================

This example is a very minimal project that will allow you to register, 
login, log out, change your password, etc. By default, you cannot go
to the groupusers url as users are not added to any group. You can 
override this by adding:

::

    apex.default_user_group = users

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   config.yaml
   development.ini
   init
   models
   views


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
